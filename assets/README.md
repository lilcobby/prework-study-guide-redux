# prework-study-guide-redux


## Description
My motivation for creating this website was, with as little help as possible, go from zero knowledge of usable webpages to creating a webpage that functions. It somewhat proves what I am capable of.
I built this webpage as a monument to my introduction into web development.
The page consolidates a few notes into one easy to read location with some added glammer.
The syntax of the code seems to be the most difficult to learn just becasue of the volume of information, but the most valuable piece of information I pulled from creating this project was the git flow. Which honestly I still need to practice. 


## Installation

## Usage
Navigate to the website url> right click and inspect element> navigate to the console> refresh the page to generate a prompt of what to study if you are stuck. 

Otherwise, 
Just study the notes or add more by editing the index.html file.
